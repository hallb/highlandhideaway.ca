# Guest Access

Guests have access to the entire house and 23 acre property except the shed and two locked closets where our personal belongings are kept. The water access across the road is a public dock and boat launch used by a handful of cottages across the lake that only have boat access. Most of the time there is no one around and you have the dock to yourself.

# Other details

The water in the house is from a drilled well. We drink the water, but you are certainly welcome to bring your own.

The house is on a septic system.

Guests are responsible for bringing the following items:
- toiletries (soap, shampoo, etc...)
- all bedding (fitted sheets, flat sheets, pillow cases, blankets). We provide pillows and comforters.
- towels
- child life jackets if needed

Winter is a beautiful time of the year here. Come prepared with snow tires and/or 4 wheel drive. Our cottage is high up on the hill and is not always accessible by car in the winter. There is parking at the bottom of the driveway and a 1-2 minute walk to the top if the driveway is not accessible.
